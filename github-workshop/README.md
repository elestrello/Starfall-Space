# GitHub Workshop Folder

Hello and Welcome to the Git Good Workshop! This folder contains the materials and slides for the Git Good: Introduction to GitHub workshop. 

## Contents

* [Introductions.md](./Introductions.md) is the file you will be editing as part of exercise 2. Please ensure that you write your answer next to the question that was assigned to you in the Getting Started Issue.
* [Widening-Participation-Git-Good-Workshop-2023.pdf](./Widening-Participation-Git-Good-Workshop-2023.pdf) is a pdf version of the slides from the workshop. You will be able to view these and use them as a reference after the session.
* [README.md](./README.md) is this document you're reading now! Remember that a README file is like the first page of a website - so when you open a folder (which is called a "directory") it's the document you are greeted with.
