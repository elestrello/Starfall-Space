# How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ 

As a template, this repository can be directly copied to start a new project with standard files and processes required in any collaborative data science and research project.

Although we also use open research practices by sharing this repository public for further reuse in different projects, users will have the ability to change and select the appropriate license and access levels for their collaborators.

To learn more about why we recommend creating a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, please read the [Contributors and Communication Pathways chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-contributors.html) in *The Turing Way* Guide for Project Design.

The **Template** repository is developed for **sessions as part of the _Git Good: Introduction to GitHub_ workshop and follows the practices and reccomendations of [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)**.

We have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to all of the activities related to this workshop during the summer school.

‚≠êÔ∏è You are acknowledged for all kinds of contributions

In this repository, we use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) that help us recognise all contributors, even when they don't directly contribute on the repository.
You can find all [emoji/Type keywords](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) representing the types of contribution. 

To add a contributor, comment on Issue or Pull Request (where the contributor is involved) using this message for @all-contributors:
`@all-contributors please add @<username> for <keyword in the Type column>`

## Whatever is your availability, there is a way to contribute to this GitHub repository.

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](../../issues).
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
